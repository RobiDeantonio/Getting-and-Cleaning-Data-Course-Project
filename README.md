# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Class Project for ["Getting and Cleaning Data"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/home/welcome)
The class project for Getting and Cleaning Data was to read in the **"Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones"** data set, perform an analysis on the data set, and output a tidy data set.

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available in this[site](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

[Here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) are the data for the project:

**Here are the steps that must be performed before running the R script:**

1. Download the zip file.
2. Unzip the file.
3. Select directory that you prefer and replace in the R script for read the next data files:
    * features.txt
    * subject_train.txt
    * subject_test.txt
    * X_train.txt
    * X_test.txt
    * y_train.txt
    * y_test.txt

Once those steps are complete, you can run the R script (run_analysis.R).

The output of the R script is a tidy data set, tidy.csv.
